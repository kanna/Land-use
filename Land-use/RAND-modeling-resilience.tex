\subsection*{Policy Need}

Extreme weather events are at a rise, with substantial increases not
only in intensity but also frequency. NOAA's National Centers for
Environmental Information, lists \$33 Million worth of property damage
from coastal events including Coastal Flood, Flash Flood, Storm
Surge/Tide, and Tropical storms in 227 events in 2022 alone, up from
201 events and \$25.5 Million worth of damage. Science and technology
have made rapid strides to predict such events and at a point where
modeling, systems, processes and strategies can be brought to bear to
mitigate human impact. Such tools can be used to stress-test the
preparedness of emergency responders and disaster management agencies,
while also providing strategic advice on asset allocation and
placement centrally focused on the importance of environmental
justice.
