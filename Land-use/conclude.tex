\subsection*{Concluding Remarks}

There is increasing need to have an integrative view of how coastal and
off-shore events tie into not only a predictive capability, but also a
tool-set to enable data/hypothesis driven informed policy which in turn
lead to concrete plans and actions for emergency responders in shore and
on land. The integration of coastal riverine, land use and ocean
dynamics coupled with a logistical course of action (COA) will allow
precisely such 'electronic table-top' driven exercises to prepare
agencies such as FEMA, Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers to do
'what-if-analyses' to ensure preparedness. To do so, we need not only
high resolution models but 'hard' and 'soft' observations from embedded
and in-situ sensors on mobile and static platforms (autonomous or not)
coupled together with a predictive capability which can be run
effectively, interactively and efficiently anytime.
